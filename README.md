## FMX MaxClientHeight Tests

I have posted a test case to the English Delphi-Praxis forum with code,
but the code has already changed, any update on the test code will go here.

Needs testing on machines with different screen settings.

I will probably tidy it up as we go,
but I start out with the readme notes as is.

Relates to a bug found.
Currently there is kind of a workaround, but no fix.

I will accept pull request.

## Test Environment

- Delphi 10.3.2
- Windows 10

## Compiling

I have chosen to ignore the .dproj and .res files.
It is therefor recommended that you create a new, empty fmx project in place and add App\FormMain as main form,
instead of running with an autogenerated .dproj.
(An autogenerated .dproj would have the target dirs for dcus and exe wrong.)
