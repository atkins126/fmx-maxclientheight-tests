## FMX MaxClientHeight Tests

I have posted a test case to the English Delphi-Praxis forum with code,
but the code has already changed, any update on the test code will go here.

Needs testing on machines with different screen settings.

I will probably tidy it up as we go,
but I start out with the readme notes as is.

Relates to a bug found.
Currently there is kind of a workaround, but no fix.

I will accept pull request.

## Test Environment

- Delphi 10.3.2
- Windows 10
