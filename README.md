## FMX MaxClientHeight Tests

I have posted a test case to the English Delphi-Praxis forum with code,
but the code has already changed, any update on the test code will go here.

It relates to a reported bug (RSP-26601).

Currently there is kind of a workaround, but no fix.

## Test Environment

- Delphi 10.3.2
- Windows 10

## Compiling

I have chosen to ignore the .dproj and .res files.

It is therefore recommended that you create a new, empty fmx project in place and add App\FrmMain as main form,
instead of running with an autogenerated .dproj.

An autogenerated .dproj would have the target dirs for dcus and exe wrong.
