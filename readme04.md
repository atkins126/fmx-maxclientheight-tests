# Test Case 01

The form has just two buttons, Button1 and Button2.

- run app
- click Button1
- click Button2
- watch how the view gets distorted.

This is a **minimal** test case, which shows the problem,
but it is not flexible enough to experiment and find out more.

What the cause of the problem is, and what the fix for it might be, is unknown at this time.
