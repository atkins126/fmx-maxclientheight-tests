## Test Case 01

The form has just two buttons, Button1 and Button2.

- run app
- click Button1
- click Button2
- watch how the view gets distorted.

It is the minimal test case, which shows the problem,
but which is, in this form, not flexible enough to experiment and find out more.

What the cause of the problem is or any possible fix for it is unknown at this time.
